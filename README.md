# Dating-Website-Animation
<p>Animation for the Codepen challenge "Bump." I was inspired to create an animation for a hypothetical dating website, based on the idea of "bumping into" your soulmate. Animating the heart and the two icons was a challenge for me. A <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21469350/not-possible-to-use-css-calc-with-transformtranslatex-in-ie">thread on Stack Overflow</a> helped me figure out how to make the icons bump without overlapping each other, and I figured out how to make the heart beat from <a href="https://www.florin-pop.com/blog/2019/03/css-pulse-effect">a tutorial on Florinpop's website</a> The icons were from SVGRepo, and I added the color.</p>
<p>If you want to check out this animation, you can view it on Codepen <a href="https://codepen.io/TurtleQueenCoding/full/WNMJemY">here</a>.</p>
